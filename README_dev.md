Package mixAR provides functions for modelling with mixture autoregressive
(mixAR) models.

See the [overview of mixAR-package](./reference/mixAR-package.html).

*TODO:* The above link is temporary. It is here to allow following it when the
    pkgdown site is build locally. It would be valid also on the pkgdown site on
    github but not in README on CRAN. The link should be changed to the github
    site of mixAR, when it is created. Eventually a proper overview should be
    included directly in this file.

*TODO:* This file should eventually be renamed to README.md and the *TODO:*
    notes removed.
